Script
======

Python and Bash scripts are stored in ``scripts`` directory for efficient file handling and
data analysis.

In Python scripts, modules of mushroom package are usually imported, e.g. ``logger``, ``cell``.

Package-specific script is prefixed by package identifier. See `Package identifier`_.
