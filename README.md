A **M**ulti-f**U**nctional, **S**imple and **H**elpful **R**esearch t**OO**lkit for **M**aterial science

This is just a contrived name for yet another analysis tool for scientific computations in material science.

*N.B.*: I am not proficient at Python programming.
I have been searching for a better way to write efficient, readable and maintainable code,
and hopefully will do in the days to come.
Any suggestions concerning code style, feature, etc, are totally welcome.
